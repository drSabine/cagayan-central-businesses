# Cagayan Business

A map-based dashboard of registered businesses for the Provincial Government of Cagayan, built for the PGC Digital Innovation Challenge. Prototype video due October 30, 2026.
Two audiences: a role-protected Capitol workspace (Super Admin, Admin, and Staff) and the public (no login, sales as bands only, a start-a-business guide, citizen wishes).
MVP: Tuguegarao City's 49 barangays. Real boundaries and population, simulated business records labeled "Simulated data".

## Stack

Laravel 13 (PHP 8.3), Inertia 3, React 19 with TypeScript, Vite 8 (through vite-plus, `vp`), Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui on Radix, Fortify for login, Wayfinder for typed routes, PostgreSQL 17 with PostGIS 3.5 in Docker, Pest 4. There is no separate API: controllers render React pages through Inertia.

## Start every session like this

1. Run `git branch --show-current`. If it says `main` or `staging`, create a work branch inside `staging` before changing anything: `git switch staging`, `git pull --ff-only`, `git switch -c feat/short-description` (or `bug/`, `data/`, `docs/`, `chore/`). `main` is production, `staging` is development, and work branches merge back into `staging` only. Rules: `docs/team/workflow.md`.
2. Read the doc for the area you will touch (table below). The team has a frontend developer, a backend developer, and a data and content member (`docs/team/workflow.md`, "Roles"). The Data object is the contract between frontend and backend.
3. Read `docs/plan/README.md` and resume the matching active plan. Use `/plan-history` for agreed work: record scope, dated changes and verification using `yy-mm-dd`; archive completed plans and reference them in later improvements. Then build the smallest agreed slice that works end to end.

## Commands

All work in PowerShell. Add new tasks as Composer scripts, never as bash or PowerShell scripts.

- `composer setup`: first-time setup on a fresh clone. Safe to rerun.
- `composer dev`: run the app at http://localhost:8000 (server, queue, Vite).
- `composer ci:check`: everything CI runs: front end format and lint, TypeScript, Pint, PHPStan, Pest.
- For every task that changes `resources/js/`, `resources/css/`, or Vite configuration, run `npm run check`, `npm run types:check`, and `npm run build` before reporting the work done. `npm run check` formats and lints but does not type-check; the TypeScript command catches unresolved names and imports. The build catches bundling errors. If formatting needs fixes, run `npm run check:fix`, then rerun all three checks.
- `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/PostgisTest.php`: one file. Add `--filter="name"` for one test.
- `composer lint`: fix PHP formatting. `npm run check:fix`: fix front end formatting and lint.
- `composer db:up`: start the database. `composer db:reset`: rebuild the demo dataset.
- `composer data:towns`: reload town figures (`data/towns/`) and Tuguegarao barangay population (`data/barangays/`).
- `composer data:finances`: load COA finance figures and sign-offs into the ledger (`data/towns/finances/`). `php artisan finances:export` saves sign-offs and manual figures back to those CSVs.
- `composer data:finances:extract` and `composer data:finances:test`: rerun or test the local Python COA parser (`tools/coa/`, D34).
- `php artisan metrics:refresh`: rebuild every `stats_` summary table.
- `composer doctor`: check this machine and the database, with a fix for each failure.

Git hooks run checks on their own: fast checks on `git commit`, the full `ci:check` and a build on `git push`. Never bypass them with `--no-verify`.

## How a request flows

```
route -> Form Request -> controller -> Query (read) or Action (write) -> Data object -> Inertia page -> components
```

- **Routes:** named `public.*` or `capitol.*`. Capitol routes live in one group with `auth` and `can:capitol`.
- **Controllers:** thin. Call one Query or Action, render one page or redirect. No business rules, loops, or `DB::` calls.
- **Queries** (`app/Queries/`) read `stats_` tables and return Data objects. **Actions** (`app/Actions/`) do one write each. **Services** (`app/Services/`) hold rules shared by several of them, such as the privacy guard.
- **Data objects** (`app/Data/`): plain readonly classes with exactly the fields a page needs. Pages never get models.
- **Pages** (`resources/js/pages/`) receive typed props and arrange the screen. Shared UI goes in `resources/js/components/`.

Details and examples: `docs/engineering/architecture.md` (back end) and `docs/engineering/frontend.md` (front end).

## How to write code here

- **Simple first.** Write the shortest clear code that solves today's task. No layer, interface, abstraction, or option "for later".
- **Performance by default.** Eager load with `with()` (lazy loading throws outside production), paginate lists, stream exports with `lazyById()`, aggregate in SQL, send only the props a page renders.
- **Reuse before writing.** Search `app/Queries`, `app/Services`, `app/Data`, model scopes, `resources/js/components`, and `components/ui` first. Extract shared code on the third copy, not the first.
- **Do not over-split.** Keep markup in the page until it repeats or the file passes about 200 lines. No one-line wrapper components, no pass-through props, no `index.ts` re-exports.
- **Comments only when the reason is not obvious from the code.** One short line, saying why, not what. No commented-out code. PHPDoc only where PHPStan needs types (array shapes, generics).
- **Follow sibling files** for naming and structure. Use `php artisan make:*` with `--no-interaction` to create files.
- **Login remains Fortify for the prototype. The approved workspace profile is separate from the removed starter settings.** The rest of the starter kit was removed (decisions.md, O8). Do not add public registration or new identity providers without a decision. Future Microsoft/Google sign-in must identify existing local users without granting roles.
- **No new packages** without asking. A new package needs a line in `docs/engineering/decisions.md`.

## UI rules

- Start UI work with `/ui-builder`. The design system is `docs/engineering/design.md`: tokens, Geist for words and Geist Mono for numbers, 2px corners, halftone dots for map data.
- Title Case for titles, headings, buttons, tabs, and badges. Sentence case for sentences. Proper nouns right.
- No em dashes, en dashes, or middots anywhere in the interface.
- Titles and headings are one name with no separators: no commas, dashes, middots, or pipes.
- No gradients. Colors from tokens only (`bg-primary`, `bg-map-3`, `text-status-closed`), never raw hex or palette classes.
- Dark mode uses muted blue slate surfaces that complement the map's river ink blue, with a lighter base than the original near-black theme. Keep text and control borders readable.
- Every data view handles loading, empty, not available, hidden, and error. "Not available" and "hidden" are never shown as `0`.
- Filters and tabs live in the URL. URL changes do not require server visits: sorting, views, loaded-data filters and cached map selections MUST use local Inertia history. Fetch only missing/stale authorized datasets, deduplicate and cache them by data identity, never by presentation state. Verify zero application requests for loaded-data interactions, including repeated selections and Back/Forward. See frontend.md, "Local Selection Contract". After a write, redirect and show a toast. Links use Wayfinder imports, never hard-coded URLs.
- The Home map right panel shows only population, revenue, and expenditure and their sources. Do not add other measures or sources without an explicit request.
- Home maps share one icon-only style control beside the main town selector. Do not repeat it in About the Data. Reuse cached census data and geometry when revisiting towns; style changes must not reload data or clear selection.
- Wish form selections update locally. Fetch only the optional tally in the background, never the entire form payload. Business Type is visible by default; reveal Specific Business only through its control or when editing an existing company wish.
- Preserve existing layouts when adding information. Do not add instructions, legends, containers, or explanatory copy unless requested or necessary for the requested interaction.
- Finance review follows `design.md`, "Government Finances Simplification": one aligned table, right-hand fiscal filter, compact linked sources, on-demand selection and quiet pagination. Do not restore source-card strips, repeated year subtitles, 0 selected, permanent bulk controls or an inner width cap that leaves an empty side strip.
- Do not add dangling metric/privacy disclaimers, automatic snapshot captions, chart-size explanations, or fallback instructions that reference removed views. Keep definitions in docs and secondary provenance/date in an accessible contextual tooltip. Home has working wish/Economy actions; do not restore placeholder cards or the removed protection section.
- Keep interface copy concise. Do not add helper descriptions that repeat a heading, label, placeholder, or button, or examples that restate what a field already accepts. Add explanatory text only when it clarifies an action, requirement, or consequence the control itself does not communicate.
- Before changing an existing screen, follow `docs/engineering/design.md`, "Working on Existing Screens". It records the user's layout, copy, map, form, source, and validation corrections. Do not reintroduce removed statistics, helper paragraphs, legends, modals, map CTAs, or duplicated controls under another label. Use underlined links without decorative arrows.

Full rules: `docs/engineering/design.md`.

## Capitol Workspace Decisions

- Approved Revenue + Economic Status direction: retain verified city/municipal government revenue as explicitly labeled context alongside economic activity, household conditions, business records, and community interests. Government revenue is not private-business sales, GDP, or a prosperity/investment score; national transfers also affect it. GDP and survey figures retain their source geography and period, so province figures never become town/barangay figures. Keep the business-information purpose; no auditing pivot. See docs/product/mvp-scope.md, "October 24, 2026 clarification: Revenue and Economic Status". The foundation labels Government Revenue and Government Expenses explicitly and withholds unchecked figures. Four 2024 COA originals are verified; further extraction follows the Finance Ledger and Analytics Program.

- Finance Ledger and Analytics Program, approved October 27, 2026 (docs/plan/active/26-10-27-finance-ledger-analytics-program.md). It covers six parts: a local Python COA parser (D34); one finance ledger for parsed and manually entered figures, with sign-off by someone other than the person who entered the figure (D35); revenue sources, business taxes and fees, and development spending from the audit-report workbooks (trimmed to a business focus 26-10-28); industries plus Focus Tags (D36); and a public and Capitol analytics engine. COA records describe the local government, not private business revenue or measured demand. Definitions (metrics.md M19 to M31, approved October 28, 2026), source verification and restatements accompany every series. Audit opinions, audit findings and infrastructure project lists are excluded. Full-year 2026 actuals wait for a released report.

- Fixed labeled desktop sidebar with no collapse control or selected-tab accent bars; compact mobile menu and breadcrumb strip.
- Map selections and geographic breadcrumbs use client-side Inertia history, not server visits. Cache each town dataset and keep the map mounted during selection.
- Do not add descriptions below page titles. Do not restore removed explanatory paragraphs about expressed interest, unavailable workflows, or boundary limitations on workspace screens. Keep provenance and limitations in data documentation.
- Map first with MapLibre and selected-area details. Omit the requests/approvals placeholder until workflows exist. No fabricated counts or approval controls.
- Community Wishes is a separate Admin/Super Admin page. Never send wishes to Staff or any dashboard response, including the map.
- Province-wide economic summaries are available to all three roles. Staff editing is restricted to assigned towns; business editing remains future work.
- Only Super Admin sees Activity Logs and may change roles. Admin manages Staff accounts and business categories when their management screens are built.
- Compact greeting with stored display name, date, and 24-hour Philippine clock. Keep the role in the sidebar account area only. Birthday month/day is optional and private; never collect birth year.
- Token styles only. Shared Capitol pieces in components/capitol, maps in components/map, semantic icons in lib/icons.ts, hooks and formatters outside pages.
- Session: 30 minutes idle, 8 hours absolute, 2 minute warning. Background requests never extend idle time. Verify expiry on the server before ending a shared session. Encrypt Inertia history and clear it on sign-in/logout/expiry.
- Input constraints live in config/cagayan.php and are supplied to forms. Display names are 1–100 Unicode characters without markup/control characters. Future business names use VARCHAR(55). Never silently truncate or force name capitalization.
- Contact and other future business-field formats require approval when those forms are planned.
- New private records use random UUID public identifiers; geographic PSGC codes remain public. Every protected action still requires server authorization.
- No individual business sales or protected field values in audit events. Activity Logs is append only, with safe event codes and actor keys.

## Rules that are never broken

- No single business's sales ever leaves the server.
- Every sales figure comes from the privacy guard.
- Pages get Data objects, never models, including shared props.
- Admin fields only behind login, and every full record view is logged.
- Every screen and export with business records shows the "Simulated data" label.
- Thresholds live in `config/cagayan.php`, never as literals.
- Metrics are defined in `docs/engineering/metrics.md` and computed in SQL. A definition changes only with a human-approved doc change.
- Checklist content needs an official source and a verification date from a team member. Never write a requirement from memory.
- Tests run on PostGIS, never SQLite.
- Never edit a migration that has been merged. Add a new one.
- Docker (`compose.yaml`, `docker/`) is shared by the whole team and CI. Change it only when the task is about Docker, as its own `chore/` pull request. Per-laptop settings such as the port go in `.env`. Never run commands that delete the database (`docker compose down -v`, `docker volume rm`).
- Never commit or push directly to `main` or `staging`. Work pull requests go into `staging`. `main` changes only by a release from `staging`. Never force push a shared branch, never skip hooks.
- No attribution trailers or generated-by text in commits or pull requests.

If a product rule, metric, or privacy rule looks wrong, or two docs disagree, stop and ask. Do not resolve it quietly.

## Skills

Start each task from one:

- `/plan-history`: maintain agreed plans, changes, checks, and archive under `docs/plan/`.
- `/feature-builder C3`: build one feature as a tested vertical slice.
- `/metric-builder M10`: build one metric in SQL, test first.
- `/db-change <what>`: change the schema with its model, factory, seeder, and doc.
- `/checklist-content <item>`: add a start-a-business guide item from an official source.
- `/commit`: run the checks, review the diff, commit, and print the pull request description.
- `/open-pr`: push and open the pull request into `staging`.
- `/privacy-check` or the `privacy-reviewer` agent: before committing anything that touches business data.
- `/ui-builder <screen>`: build or restyle a screen from the design system.
- `/design-check`: before committing a UI change.
- `/demo-check`: before recording or the booth.

## Done means

Acceptance checks met. Tests pass, including privacy cases. `composer ci:check` green. Loading, empty, not available, hidden, and error states handled. Simulated label shown. Wording follows `design.md` and `privacy-rules.md`. Roadmap status updated. When Claude gets something wrong twice, add the correction here or in `.claude/rules/` in the same pull request.

Where the Laravel Boost guidelines below disagree with this file, this file wins.

===

<laravel-boost-guidelines>
=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.3. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists, including path-scoped framework guidelines under `.ai/rules/boost`. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill before writing tests.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

# Inertia v3

- Use all Inertia features from v1, v2, and v3. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New v3 features: standalone HTTP requests (`useHttp` hook), optimistic updates with automatic rollback, layout props (`useLayoutProps` hook), instant visits, simplified SSR via `@inertiajs/vite` plugin, custom exception handling for error pages.
- Carried over from v2: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.
- Axios has been removed. Use the built-in XHR client with interceptors, or install Axios separately if needed.
- `Inertia::lazy()` / `LazyProp` has been removed. Use `Inertia::optional()` instead.
- Prop types (`Inertia::optional()`, `Inertia::defer()`, `Inertia::merge()`) work inside nested arrays with dot-notation paths.
- SSR works automatically in Vite dev mode with `@inertiajs/vite` - no separate Node.js server needed during development.
- Event renames: `invalid` is now `httpException`, `exception` is now `networkError`.
- `router.cancel()` replaced by `router.cancelAll()`.
- The `future` configuration namespace has been removed - all v2 future options are now always enabled.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Use Wayfinder to generate TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

# Pest

- This project uses Pest. Create tests with `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.
- Do not delete tests or test files without approval. They are part of the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `php artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/pest` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.
- After the feature tests pass, ask the user to run the complete suite with `php artisan test --compact`.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.
