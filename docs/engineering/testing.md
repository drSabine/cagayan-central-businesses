# Testing

How to write tests that are quick to run and that people trust. Read this before writing or changing a test.

Pest 4 on PostgreSQL with PostGIS. Run one file with `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/PostgisTest.php`, one test with `--filter="hides sales"`, everything with `php artisan test --compact`.

## What a good test here looks like

- **Tests behavior, not code.** It calls a route or a class the way real code does, and checks the result: status, redirect, Inertia props, database rows. It survives a refactor that keeps the behavior.
- **Fast.** No demo seeder, no sleeping, no network. Build the few rows the test needs with factories.
- **Reliable.** Same result every run, in any order, on any laptop.
- **Says what broke.** The name reads as a sentence. One behavior per test.

```php
it('hides sales for a group below the minimum size', function () {
    $min = config('cagayan.privacy.small_group_min');

    $figure = app(PrivacyGuard::class)->figure(total: '900000.00', count: $min - 1, maxSingle: '300000.00');

    expect($figure->state)->toBe('hidden')
        ->and($figure->reason)->toBe('small_group');
});
```

## Where tests go

```
tests/
  Feature/
    Capitol/     Capitol pages and actions, one file per feature (BarangayProfileTest.php)
    Public/      public pages and the wish form
    Metrics/     one file per metric (NetGrowthTest.php)
    Privacy/     cross-cutting privacy rules (sentinel scans, guard behavior)
    Seeder/      the seeder requirement checks
    Auth/        login, logout, and the removed starter kit routes
  Unit/          pure PHP with no database: the privacy guard, sales bands, enums
  Arch/          architecture rules (arch() tests)
```

Create a folder with its first real test. Name files after the behavior's subject: `WishSubmissionTest.php`, not `WishControllerTest.php`.

Style: Pest functions (`it()`, `test()`, `expect()`). Create new files with `php artisan make:test --pest NameTest`.

## Speed

The suite should stay under a minute.

- **Unit tests for pure logic.** The privacy guard, band selection, and enum helpers need no database and run in milliseconds. Put them in `tests/Unit/` and do not boot the database there.
- **Transactions, not migrations.** `RefreshDatabase` migrates once, then wraps each test in a transaction that rolls back.
- **Small fixtures.** Two or three barangays and a handful of businesses. Never the demo seeder, except in `tests/Feature/Seeder/`.
- **Cheap passwords.** `BCRYPT_ROUNDS=4` in `phpunit.xml` (already set).
- **Fakes for slow things.** `Notification::fake()`, `Mail::fake()`, `Queue::fake()`, `Storage::fake()`.
- **Run narrow while working**, full before pushing. The pre-push hook runs the full suite.
- **Parallel when needed.** If the suite passes a minute, try `php artisan test --parallel`. Paratest is installed.
- **Find slow tests** with `php artisan test --profile`.

## Reliability

| Cause of flaky tests | Do this |
| :- | :- |
| The clock | Freeze it: `$this->travelTo(now()->setDate(2026, 10, 1))` |
| Random data that matters | Set it explicitly in the factory call. Faker only for values the test does not check. |
| Network calls | `Http::preventStrayRequests()` and `Http::fake()` |
| Test order | Each test builds its own data. Never rely on another test's rows. |
| Shared config | Change config inside the test with `config([...])`. It resets after each test. |
| Thresholds | Build fixtures from `config('cagayan....')`, never a hardcoded `5`, so a changed threshold cannot leave a test passing for the wrong reason. |

## Assertions

Assert on structure, not on page text.

```php
$this->actingAs($admin)
    ->get(route('capitol.barangays.show', $barangay))
    ->assertOk()
    ->assertInertia(fn (Assert $page) => $page
        ->component('capitol/barangays/show')
        ->where('profile.sales.state', 'hidden')
        ->where('profile.sales.reason', 'small_group')
        ->missing('profile.sales.value'));
```

- Status and redirect: `assertOk()`, `assertRedirect(route('login'))`, `assertForbidden()`, `assertTooManyRequests()`.
- Props: `assertInertia()` with `where()`, `has()`, `missing()`.
- Database: `assertDatabaseHas()`, `assertDatabaseCount()`.
- Text only when the text itself is the rule, for example the "Simulated data" label.
- Hidden is never zero: assert the state and reason, and that no value is present.

## Patterns this project needs

### Route guards in one test

One dataset test covers every protected route, including routes added later.

```php
dataset('capitol routes', fn () => collect(Route::getRoutes())
    ->filter(fn ($route) => str_starts_with($route->getName() ?? '', 'capitol.'))
    ->map(fn ($route) => [$route])
    ->all());

it('sends guests to login', function ($route) {
    $this->call($route->methods()[0], url($route->uri()))->assertRedirect(route('login'));
})->with('capitol routes');
```

Routes with parameters need a record to bind. Build one in a `beforeEach`.

### CSRF in Laravel 13

Laravel 13's CSRF middleware (`PreventRequestForgery`) switches itself off while tests run, so a request without a token does not return 419 in a test. Check instead that every state-changing route is in the `web` middleware group, which applies it.

### Privacy tests assert absence

Seed a sentinel value (a distinctive sales amount like `987654321.12`, an owner name like `Sentinel Owner`), call every relevant route, and assert the sentinel appears nowhere in the response.

```php
expect($response->getContent())->not->toContain('987654321.12');
```

### Metric tests use hand-built fixtures

A tiny fixture, the hand calculation in a comment above the assertion, `$this->artisan('metrics:refresh')->assertSuccessful()`, then assert the stored value. Add one test for "not available", and one for "hidden" when sales are involved. Never test a metric against the demo seeder.

### Rate limit tests check behavior

Send the allowed number of requests, then one more, and expect 429. Do not rebuild Laravel's internal throttle key in the test.

```php
foreach (range(1, 10) as $i) {
    $this->post(route('public.wishes.store'), $payload());
}
$this->post(route('public.wishes.store'), $payload())->assertTooManyRequests();
```

### Mass assignment

For every store and update route, post a field the user must not control (`role`, `is_simulated`, `user_id`) and assert it did not change.

### Architecture rules

```php
arch('controllers do not query the database directly')
    ->expect('App\Http\Controllers')
    ->not->toUse('Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB');

arch('no debugging leftovers')
    ->expect(['dd', 'dump', 'ray', 'var_dump'])
    ->not->toBeUsed();
```

## Proving a security test works

Before trusting a new security test, break the protection on purpose (remove the middleware or the check), run the test, and watch it fail. Then restore the protection. A test that passes either way proves nothing.

## What not to test

- Framework behavior (that `required` rejects empty input, that Eloquent saves).
- The same thing twice at two layers.

## Never

- Delete or weaken a test to make a change pass. If a test looks wrong, stop and ask.
- Use SQLite.
- Leave `->only()` or `->skip()` in committed tests.

## Audit backlog

From the October 3, 2026 review. To be done later, in this order:

1. Route guard dataset test: state-changing routes sit in the `web` group. Guests already get a 404 on every Capitol route, never a redirect to the login (D20), and `CapitolAccessTest` checks each one.
2. Done October 5, 2026: the shared `auth.user` prop is the `SessionUser` Data object (name only), locked by `CapitolAccessTest`.
3. Convert the starter kit's class-style tests to Pest (`./vendor/bin/pest --drift`), move `RefreshDatabase` into `tests/Pest.php` once, delete `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php` and `tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
4. Rewrite the login rate-limit test to send six bad logins instead of rebuilding the throttle key.
