# Database change

The change to make: $ARGUMENTS

`docs/engineering/database.md` is the schema of record. The migration and that document change together, or the next session builds on a wrong picture.

## Read first

1. `docs/engineering/database.md`: "Schema rules", "Visibility classes", the tables involved, "Seeder requirements".
2. `docs/engineering/privacy-rules.md`, "Field classes", if the change touches `businesses`, `business_years`, `wishes`, or `record_view_logs`.
3. `database/migrations/`: what already exists.

## Steps

1. **Branch.** If on `main` or `staging`, create a work branch inside `staging`: `feat/<id>-<short-name>` or `chore/<short-name>`.
2. **Restate the change** as tables and columns with types, keys, and indexes. If it differs from `database.md`, say exactly how and ask before going ahead. A schema that drifts from the doc is how privacy fields leak.
3. **Write a new migration:** `php artisan make:migration <name> --no-interaction`. Never edit a migration merged to `staging` (check with `git log origin/staging -- database/migrations/<file>`). One migration may create several related tables.
4. **Follow the schema rules:**
   - Not null unless "unknown" is a real state.
   - `constrained()` foreign keys, restrict on delete unless the child cannot exist alone.
   - Unique constraints for business rules. `enum()` for enum columns.
   - PSGC `string(10)`, money `decimal(16, 2)`, years `smallInteger`.
   - Geometry `geometry('boundary', subtype: 'multipolygon', srid: 4326)` or `point`, plus `spatialIndex()`.
   - An index for every foreign key and every frequent `where`, `join`, or `order by` column.
5. **Update everything that depends on it, together:**
   - the model: `#[Fillable]`, `#[Hidden]` (the sales column and every never-displayed field), `casts()` with enums and `'decimal:2'`, relationships with return types
   - one backed enum per enum column in `app/Enums/`
   - the factory, with states the tests will need
   - the seeder, if the table is seeded
6. **Update `docs/engineering/database.md`** so it matches the migration exactly.
7. **Prove it:** `composer db:reset`, then `php artisan test --compact`.
8. **Say which summary tables are affected** (`stats_area_year`, `stats_type_cohort`, `stats_outlook`) and which metrics may need a `/metric-builder` follow-up.

## Done when

A new migration exists, the model, enums, factory, and seeder match it, `database.md` matches it, `composer db:reset` and the tests pass, and the person knows which summary tables are affected. Then suggest `/commit`.
