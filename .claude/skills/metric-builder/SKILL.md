# Build metric $metric

Every number on screen has one definition, one SQL implementation, and one test (decision D7). The definition is fixed. The code follows it, never the reverse.

## Read first

1. `docs/engineering/metrics.md`: "Building blocks", "Three states every value can be in", the entry for $metric, "Config values", "How each metric is tested".
2. `docs/engineering/database.md`: "Summary tables" and the `business_years` status rules.
3. `docs/engineering/privacy-rules.md` if $metric involves sales (M3, M4, M5 by sales, M6 and M7 by sales, M12, M15).
4. `app/Console/Commands/RefreshMetricsCommand.php` and what is already in `database/sql/metrics/`.

## Steps

1. **Branch.** If on `main` or `staging`, create a work branch inside `staging`: `feat/<metric-id>-<short-name>` (for example `feat/m1-net-growth`).
2. **Check the definition.** Anything ambiguous (a denominator, a tie, a year boundary, a missing case): stop and ask. Items marked **Choice** in `metrics.md` are settled defaults. Use them as written.
3. **Check what it needs.** Most metrics read `stats_area_year`. If it or the raw tables do not exist yet, stop and say which skill runs first (`/db-change`, or `/metric-builder M1`, which creates `stats_area_year`).
4. **Write the test first** in `tests/Feature/Metrics/`, named after the metric (`NetGrowthTest.php`):
   - A tiny hand-built fixture: two or three barangays, a handful of businesses, two to four years. Never the demo seeder.
   - Above each assertion, a short comment with the hand calculation, so a reviewer can check the arithmetic without running anything.
   - `$this->artisan('metrics:refresh')->assertSuccessful()`, then assert the stored value.
   - One test for "not available" (for example a zero denominator). It must come back as not available, not `0`.
   - For sales, one test for "hidden".
   Watch it fail.
5. **Implement in SQL** in `database/sql/metrics/<summary_table>.sql`, one file per summary table. A file rebuilds its whole table so a refresh is always complete. Keep the SQL plain and readable: a judge may be shown it.
6. **Wire it into `metrics:refresh`.** Run the files in dependency order (`stats_area_year` first) inside one transaction, so a failed refresh never leaves half-updated tables.
7. **Thresholds from config,** passed as bindings. No literals for anything in "Config values".
8. **Sales stay protected.** Only this SQL reads `declared_gross_sales`. Store totals plus `declared_sales_max_single` where the guard needs it. Hiding happens in the guard when the figure is read.
9. **Run** `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Metrics/`, then `composer db:reset` to prove the refresh runs on the demo data.
10. **Update `docs/team/roadmap.md`:** $metric to `Done`.
11. **Never edit `metrics.md` to match the code.** If the definition looks wrong, stop and raise it. Changing it needs a pull request with two reviewers.

## Done when

The metric test, its "not available" test, and (for sales) its "hidden" test pass with hand calculations in comments, `metrics:refresh` fills the table on the demo data, and the roadmap shows $metric as Done. Then suggest `/commit`.
