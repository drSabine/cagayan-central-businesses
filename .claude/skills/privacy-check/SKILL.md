# Privacy check

Scope given by the person, if any: $ARGUMENTS. Otherwise check the working tree and branch against `staging`.

With Inertia, everything a controller passes to a page reaches the browser. A leak in a prop is a leak, whether or not React shows it. The author of a change is the worst person to spot their own leak, so read the diff as a stranger would.

## Steps

1. **Read the diff:** `git diff origin/staging...HEAD` plus `git diff` for uncommitted work. List the changed files.
2. **Read `docs/engineering/privacy-rules.md` in full.** Walk P1 to P14 against the diff. For each rule: holds, broken, or does not apply.
3. **Search for the usual leaks:**
   - a model, collection of models, or `->toArray()` / `->toJson()` of a model passed to `Inertia::render`, `inertia()`, `Inertia::share`, or the shared props in `HandleInertiaRequests`
   - any read of `declared_gross_sales` outside `database/sql/metrics/`
   - a sales figure not produced by the privacy guard, or a numeric sales value in a public Data object
   - an admin field (owner name, contact number, ownership type, size category, employee count) in a public route, Data object, or page
   - a full record view without a `record_view_logs` write, or a list view that writes one
   - a threshold written as a literal instead of `config('cagayan....')`
   - a new page or export without the "Simulated data" label
   - a sales amount, owner name, or contact number in a log call, exception, or validation message
   - a new filter without a test for the hidden case
4. **Run the privacy tests** if the folders exist: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Privacy tests/Arch`.
5. **Report findings by rule id,** each with file, line, what is wrong, who could see what, and the smallest fix. With no findings, list each rule with "holds" or "does not apply".
6. **Fix only when asked.**

## Done when

Every rule P1 to P14 has a verdict for this diff, the privacy and architecture tests have run, and each finding has a file and line.
