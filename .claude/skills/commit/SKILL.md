# Commit

Make one commit a teammate can understand from the log, then hand the person a ready pull request description. Hint from the person, if any: $ARGUMENTS

Rules: `docs/team/workflow.md`, "Branching" and "Commits".

## 1. Check the branch

Run `git branch --show-current`.

- `main` or `staging`: stop. Work happens on branches inside `staging`. Propose a name (`feat/home-animations`, `bug/insert`, `data/...`, `docs/...`, `chore/...`) and, when the person agrees, run `git switch staging`, `git pull --ff-only`, `git switch -c <name>`. Uncommitted changes come along to the new branch. The hooks refuse commits on `main` and `staging` anyway.
- A name that does not follow `type/short-description`: say so, and carry on.

## 2. Read what changed

Run `git status`, `git diff`, and `git diff --staged`. Summarize the change in one sentence.

If it is more than one logical change (for example a migration plus an unrelated page fix), propose how to split it into separate commits and wait.

## 3. Review the diff for things that must not slip in

Go through each item. Report what you find before committing.

| Check | How | If found |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `.gitignore` changed | `git diff HEAD -- .gitignore` | Show the change. Ask why. A new ignore rule can hide files the team needs. A removed one can expose `.env`, build output, or dumps. Commit only with a clear reason. |
| Dependencies added, removed, or upgraded | Diff `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | List each package and version. A new package needs the person's approval and a line in `docs/engineering/decisions.md` (D6 or a new entry). The manifest and its lock file go in the same commit. Development tools belong in `require-dev` or `devDependencies`. |
| Files in `public/` | `git status -- public` | `public/build/`, `public/hot`, and `public/storage` are never committed. A new icon or image is fine if it is small (under about 200 KB) and used. |
| Secrets and private data | File names and added lines | Never stage `.env` or `.env.*` (except `.env.example`), keys, tokens, passwords, database dumps, or real business records. A new env key goes in `.env.example` with a safe default. |
| Generated files | `git status` | `resources/js/routes/`, `resources/js/actions/`, `resources/js/wayfinder/`, `vendor/`, `node_modules/` are never committed. |
| Debugging leftovers | Added lines | `dd(`, `dump(`, `ray(`, `var_dump(`, `console.log(`. Remove them. |
| Docker files changed | `git diff HEAD -- compose.yaml docker/` | The whole team and CI use them. Commit only if the task is about Docker, as its own commit. Check the image tag matches `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Put "run `composer db:up`" in the pull request's "After merging" line. |
| Edited migration | `git log origin/staging -- database/migrations/<file>` | A merged migration is never edited. Move the change to a new migration. |
| Docs that should change too | The diff | Schema: `docs/engineering/database.md`. New package or decision: `decisions.md`. Finished feature: `docs/team/roadmap.md`. |
| UI text and visuals | Changed `.tsx` | No em dashes, middots, or separators in titles. No gradients or raw colors. If unsure, run `/design-check`. |
| Business data | Controllers, Data objects, Queries, pages, exports | Run `/privacy-check` first. |

## 4. Run the checks

- Only `*.md` files changed: skip this step.
- Otherwise run the tests that cover the change, then the whole suite: `php artisan test --compact`. Stop on failure and show it. Do not commit around a red test.

The pre-commit hook runs Pint, PHPStan, the front end lint, and TypeScript when you commit, so you do not need to run them separately. If it fails, fix the cause (`composer lint`, `npm run check:fix`, or the reported error), stage again, and commit again. **Never use `--no-verify`.**

## 5. Stage named files only

`git add <path> <path>`. Never `git add .` or `git add -A`, so nothing unreviewed slips in.

## 6. Write the message

- Subject: `type(scope): subject`. Imperative, lower case after the colon, 72 characters or fewer, no period. Example: `feat(capitol): add barangay profile page`.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`, `data`.
- Scopes: `capitol`, `public`, `metrics`, `privacy`, `data`, `map`, `guide`, `infra`.
- A body only when the reason is not obvious from the subject. Then say why, in a few lines. Mention the feature or metric id (C3, M10).
- No trailers of any kind: no co-author lines, no generated-by line, no session link.

Commit with `git commit -m "<subject>"` (add `-m "<body>"` for a body). The hooks check the format. Show `git log --oneline -1`.

## 7. Print the pull request description

After every commit, print the pull request description for the **whole branch**, so the person can paste it into GitHub or hand it to `/open-pr` without another session.

1. Gather: `git log --oneline origin/staging..HEAD` and `git diff --stat origin/staging...HEAD`. The pull request goes into `staging`.
2. Read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and fill every section from the real commits and diff:
   - **Title:** one Conventional Commit line for the whole branch.
   - **What:** one or two plain sentences, plus the feature or metric id and type.
   - **Why:** the need, with a link to the doc section or issue.
   - **How:** 2 to 5 bullets naming the main files and the decision behind each.
   - **How to check it:** exact URL, account, clicks, and what the person should see.
   - **Impact:** database, dependencies, config and env, `.gitignore` and public files, privacy, breaking changes. Write "none" where nothing changed. Use what you found in step 3.
   - **When:** what it depends on, and what teammates must run after merging (`composer install`, `npm install`, `composer db:reset`, or nothing).
   - **Who:** author from `git config user.name`, reviewers from `.github/CODEOWNERS` and the two-reviewer rule.
   - **Checklist:** tick only what is true. Answer the privacy questions or write "no business data touched".
3. Print it inside one fenced `markdown` block, title first.

## 8. Never push

Pushing and opening the pull request are `/open-pr`.

## Done when

One commit exists on a work branch inside `staging`, the review in step 3 found nothing unresolved, the tests passed (or only docs changed), the hooks passed, `git log -1` shows a correct subject with no trailers, and the filled pull request description is printed.
