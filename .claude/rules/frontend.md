# Front end rules

Full guides: `docs/engineering/frontend.md` (structure and data) and `docs/engineering/design.md` (look and words).

Before editing an existing page, read design.md, "Working on Existing Screens". That section is the canonical record of the user's corrections. Preserve the requested structure, remove copy that repeats a control, and do not restore removed features under a new label.

## Structure

- **Data comes from props.** No API calls for page data, no Redux, Zustand, React Query, or Axios. Filters change the URL with `router.get(..., { preserveState: true })`.
- **Pages** in `resources/js/pages/`, folders following the route name (`capitol.barangays.show` is `pages/capitol/barangays/show.tsx`). Each page declares a `Props` type matching its PHP Data object.
- **Reuse first:** `components/ui/` (shadcn), then `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`. Missing shadcn piece: `npx shadcn@latest add <name>`.
- **Do not over-split.** Keep markup in the page until it repeats or the file passes about 200 lines. No one-line wrappers, no pass-through components, no `index.ts` re-exports.
- **No metric math in the browser.** Format only, with the helpers in `lib/`.
- **Links and forms use Wayfinder** (`@/routes`, `@/actions`). Never a hard-coded URL. `<Link>` for navigation.
- **Heavy libraries load lazily** (`React.lazy` for the map and charts) with a skeleton.
- **Map:** import from `react-map-gl/maplibre`, never the default import. Basemap is OpenFreeMap `positron` with the offline fallback in `frontend.md`, "The map". Map colors come from tokens through `mapColor()`.
- **Charts:** shadcn's `ChartContainer` (Recharts) with `--chart-*` tokens. Every chart has a table version.
- **PDF:** `@react-pdf/renderer`, templates in `resources/js/pdf/`, built only from the page's props, loaded with `import()` on click. Tailwind and shadcn do not work inside a PDF. Show the "Simulated data" label.
- **The server decides access.** Hiding something in React protects nothing. Public pages never receive admin fields.
- File names kebab-case. Components PascalCase. Hooks `use-*`.

## Look and words

The design system is `docs/engineering/design.md`. Start UI work with `/ui-builder`, finish with `/design-check`.

Do:

- Token classes for every color, space, radius, and motion value (`bg-primary`, `fill-map-3`, `gap-section`, `ease-out-soft`).
- `type-*` roles. Sans for words, `font-mono tabular-nums` for numbers, `type-label` for small uppercase labels.
- 2px corners through the `rounded-*` scale. `rounded-full` only for dots, avatars, and round icon buttons.
- Halftone dots (`lib/halftone.ts`) for map values: every dot the same size, color depth for the value. Add a key only where the approved screen requires it; Home does not have a legend.
- **Title Case** for page titles, headings, card titles, buttons, tabs, badges, nav items, form field labels, legend titles, and table headers. **Sentence case** for subtitles, descriptions, body, toasts, errors, and empty states. Proper nouns and acronyms right (Tuguegarao City, Peñablanca, PSA, PSGC).
- The year and source once per group of figures, never repeated on every row. Numbers right-aligned.
- Build on the existing layout. Change what was asked, do not redesign a page unasked.
- Fit additions within their section. Keep form and map in one shared canvas, bound dropdown heights globally, and avoid blank hero padding or vertical overlap.
- Use one shared icon control for Home map styles. Keep only population, revenue, expenditure, and their relevant sources in the main map panel.
- Keep Business Type visible by default and reveal Specific Business through its explicit control. Preserve drafts on selection changes; update only the count in the background.
- Write formal, accurate data and privacy explanations. Keep helper copy only when the control cannot communicate the requirement itself. Underline links without decorative arrows.
- Every data view: loading, empty, not available, hidden, error. Exact phrases from `docs/engineering/privacy-rules.md`, "Words on screen". Never show hidden or not available as `0`.
- Phone first, then desktop. Light and dark mode both work.

Don't:

- Em dashes, en dashes, or middots in UI text. Separators (commas, dashes, middots, pipes) in titles and headings.
- Gradients, glows, decorative patterns, dots as decoration, hex values, or palette classes like `bg-blue-500`.
- Raw `text-2xl font-bold` where a role exists, a third font, or `rounded-[...]`.
- A top nav bar on public pages, or the "Simulated data" label added page by page (it comes from the shared layout).
- Color as the only signal, or a map as the only way to pick a place.
- Dangling dashboard statistics, suggestion-count badges, numbered form instructions, repeated company examples or privacy assurances, and unrequested legends or zoom hints.
- More Details modals, Suggest a Business Here on maps, double-click requirements, duplicate style controls, or the extra barangay dropdown.

Run `npm run check:fix` after editing. The pre-commit hook runs the lint and TypeScript checks.

## Repeated UI Corrections

Follow design.md, "Government Finances Simplification", for the final approved pattern. Do not reintroduce source-card strips, repeated report-year subtitles, zero-selection counters, always-visible bulk-edit controls, independently sized category tables, loud pagination boxes or feature-level width caps that leave an empty side strip. Use compact source attribution, linked citation text, one shared table grid, right-hand fiscal filters and on-demand review mode. The shared pagination and breadcrumb contracts in frontend.md apply across the workspace.

Apply the later workspace-controls correction in design.md: actions must look actionable (Review/Cancel use outlines), Enter a Figure belongs in the right panel, source selection is called Source Report, and entry has no Note. Use contextual FieldHelp instead of permanent explanations. Do not restore shared greeting/clock rows or duplicate Profile in the primary nav. Preserve session renewal/expiry behavior, profile limits, permission-based destinations and independent review restrictions when simplifying presentation.

Sidebar account controls use a single-row Account trigger with Profile and Sign Out in its dropdown. Never show the account name or role in the sidebar; keep the appearance toggle aligned beside the trigger.
