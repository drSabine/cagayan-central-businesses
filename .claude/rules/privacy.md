# Privacy rules in short

Full rules and reasons: `docs/engineering/privacy-rules.md`. Read it before changing anything here. With Inertia, every prop reaches the browser, so protection happens on the server.

- **P1** No single business's sales leaves the server: not in props, JSON, CSV, PDF, logs, or errors. No Data object has a field for it.
- **P2** Fewer than `cagayan.privacy.small_group_min` active businesses: sales hidden, reason `small_group`. Administrators included.
- **P3** Largest single business over `cagayan.privacy.dominance_max_share` of the total: hidden, reason `dominance`. Uses `declared_sales_max_single`.
- **P4** Exactly one hidden cell in a breakdown shown beside its total: also hide the smallest remaining cell, reason `complementary`.
- **P5** The guard runs after filters, on the final group.
- **P6** Anything derived from a hidden figure is hidden: per business, share, change, rank, concentration, outlook.
- **P7** The public sees a band only, never a number. Hidden stays hidden, with no band.
- **P8** Owner name, contact number, ownership type, size category, employee count: authenticated administrators only.
- **P9** Opening a full business record writes one `record_view_logs` row before responding. The list view writes none.
- **P10** Pages get Data objects from `app/Data/`, never models, collections, or `->toArray()` of a model, including shared props in `HandleInertiaRequests`. Separate public and admin objects.
- **P11** CSV and PDF are built from the same guarded Data objects.
- **P12** Wishes store no name, contact, or raw network address. A browser is the SHA-256 hash of an anonymous signed cookie token, plus a daily keyed network hash used only to cap new respondents (D21). One new wish per 3 days, 3 edits per 7 days, from `cagayan.wishes`. Honeypot, signed form timer, plain-text reasons with no links. Reasons are admin only, plus the browser that wrote them. Rate limited per IP per hour.
- **P13** The "Simulated data" label is in the shared layout and every export.
- **P14** No sales, owner names, or contact numbers in logs or exception text.

`auth.user` is the `SessionUser` Data object (name only). Keep it that way.

Before committing, run `/privacy-check` or the `privacy-reviewer` agent.
