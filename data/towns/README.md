# Town Figures

Real public figures for Cagayan's 29 towns. The Home and workspace maps show population, Government Revenue, and Government Expenses. The other measures stay in the file for later. One file, `town-facts.csv`, loaded into the `town_facts` table by `php artisan towns:import` (or `composer data:towns`). `composer db:reset` loads it too.

Prepared on October 23, 2026.

## The file

One row per town, measure, and year:

| Column | Example | Notes |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `psgc_code` | `0201529000` | Must match `data/boundaries/cagayan-municipalities.geojson` |
| `town` | `Tuguegarao City` | For people reading the file. The import ignores it |
| `measure` | `population` | One of the measures below |
| `year` | `2024` | The year the figure is for |
| `value` | `167297` | A plain number: no commas, no peso sign, no percent sign |
| `source_url` | `https://...` | Where the figure was read. Required, `https://` only |
| `checked_on` | `2026-10-23` | The date a team member checked the figure against the official release. Blank until then |

Measures:

| Measure | Unit | Years in the file |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `population` | residents | 2020 census, 2024 census (POPCEN) |
| `barangay_count` | barangays | 2020 (PSA PSGC) |
| `income_class` | 1 to 6, the DOF income class | 2024 |
| `poverty_incidence` | percent of the population | 2023 (PSA small area estimates) |
| `revenue` | pesos | 2024 |
| `expenditure` | pesos | 2024 |

## How to update

1. Add or edit rows in `town-facts.csv`. For a new census or budget year, **add** rows with the new year. Keeping the old ones keeps the history.
2. Run `composer data:towns`. It checks every row first and imports nothing if a row is wrong, listing each problem with its line number.
3. Refresh the Home page. It uses the newest verified year of each measure. Unchecked rows stay in the source file but are withheld from responses.

The CSV is the source of truth: every import replaces the whole table with the file.

## Where the figures came from

Each `source_url` points to the original release used for that figure. The 2024 population values below were checked directly against the Cagayan tab of the PSA Region II Statistical Tables workbook:

| Measure | Original source | `source_url` |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `population` 2024 | PSA, 2024 Census of Population, Region II Statistical Tables, Cagayan tab | https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/population-and-housing/node/1684077888 |
| `population` 2020 | PSA, 2020 Census of Population and Housing, counts declared official July 2021 | https://psa.gov.ph/content/2020-census-population-and-housing-2020-cph-population-counts-declared-official-president |
| `poverty_incidence` 2023 | PSA, 2023 city and municipal poverty estimates (February 6, 2026) | https://psa.gov.ph/content/881-cities-and-municipalities-recorded-poverty-incidence-20-percent-or-lower-2023 |
| `income_class` 2024 | DOF Department Order 074-2024 (RA 11964), published by BLGF | https://blgf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DOF-DO-074.2024.pdf |
| `revenue`, `expenditure` 2024 | Each town's audited financial statements, Commission on Audit (the source Wikidata records for these values) | https://www.coa.gov.ph/reports/annual-audit-reports/aar-local-government-units/ |
| `barangay_count` | PSA PSGC page for the town | `https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc/barangays/<code>` |

Land area was dropped: it could not be traced to an official document, and nothing shows it.

The PSA source page and attached workbook were checked directly. All 29 town populations and all 820 barangay populations match the original Cagayan sheet, totaling 1,284,676; Tuguegarao totals 167,297. No other province tabs were used.

## Verification and Publication

Only rows with `checked_on` and a source URL can reach the atlas responses. Older verified rows remain eligible when a newer row is unchecked. This applies to both public and workspace maps. A verification date means source transcription was checked, not that the government's accounts are free of audit qualifications.

Four 2024 COA archives have been inspected: Abulug, Alcala, Allacapan, and Tuguegarao City. Exact values, archive links, workbook cells, checksums and audit qualifications are in [Verified Local Government Finances 2024](verified-finances-2024.md). The other 25 towns' financial figures remain unavailable pending primary-source review. Abulug revenue is now available from its 2024 original report.

The legacy `expenditure` storage key currently represents the reports' total expenses, including non-cash expenses and transfers/assistance/subsidies to other entities, not cash expenditure or appropriations. The visible label is Government Expenses. Do not reuse this key for another accounting basis without a documented schema/contract change.

## COA Source Documents

[`executive-summaries/`](executive-summaries/README.md) holds COA Executive Summary PDFs for fiscal years 2020 to 2025. The parser in `tools/coa/` reads them into [`finances/`](finances/README.md), where they wait for review before the finance ledger publishes them.

Province population/count totals require all towns to have the same reference year. City/municipal government accounts are not aggregated into a provincial-government finance figure. Full historical collection and comparable-year trends remain separate deferred work.

The 29 population rows for 2024 have `checked_on=2026-10-23`; the four verified fiscal pairs have `checked_on=2026-10-24`. Other measures stay unchecked until compared directly with their originals. Replace the source URL with an exact document when checking a figure, then fill in the verification date. Never mark a generic source page as evidence that a number was inspected.
